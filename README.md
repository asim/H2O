# H2O

The Hailo H2O microservices platform

## Overview

This repo serves as the historic record of H2O, a microservices platform built by the Hailo H2O team in 2013. Our work became the foundation for what is now the [M3O](https://m3o.com) platform. We pay tribute to what was the most game changing and advanced architecture of its time. A platform we have yet to be seen replicated in it's entirety.
