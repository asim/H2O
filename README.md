# H2O

The Hailo H2O microservices platform

## Overview

This repo serves as the historic record of H2O, a microservices platform built by the Hailo H2O team in 2013. Our work has become the foundation for what has now become the [Micro](https://github.com/micro) platform. We pay tribute to what was the most game changing and advanced architecture of its time. A platform we have yet to be seen replicated.
